But accurate measurement and tracking (marketing analytics) is the foundation and the first step towards improving your marketing – and technology is driving continued advances in how much detail can be uncovered about your business.


When speaking to business owners and prospective customers, it’s quite common to hear them tell us that they already track everything by asking their prospective clients the infamous “How did you hear about us?” question. Hmmm. The problem with this approach is that the responses are inaccurate at best, and more often than not, downright misleading. Believe it – because we’ve tracked it and found that as many as 50% of the responses to that question are simply not true or accurate.


Yet, few small and medium sized business owners are utilizing it to the fullest extent possible. Time and again we see companies treating their website and their Internet marketing strategy as an afterthought – and it’s easy to see why because this brave new world is quickly evolving in terms of advertising options and overall complexity.


Our tracking process uncovers never-before-seen insights about your business and your marketing. We use these insights, combined with our online marketing and website optimization expertise, to eliminate ineffective marketing strategies, drive more qualified visitors to your website and convert more visitors into leads and sales. We do all of this – essentially becoming your surrogate VP of marketing – for less than the cost of a single entry level employee!

If you take only two things away from visiting our website, make the second take-away the simple fact that you should be doing whatever you can to increase your company’s visibility on search engines such as Google. It’s a real estate game. It’s like the board game Monopoly. Visit Google and enter a keyword or keyword phrase that you think someone would use to find a business in your industry. If you don’t see your business at least 2 times on the first page, you are losing potential customers to your competitors. Period. The Internet is perhaps the most powerful and cost-effective sales and marketing tool at your disposal.
